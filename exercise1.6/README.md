I used the command given to run the container:

```
docker run -it devopsdockeruh/pull_exercise
```

After this, we are prompt for a password. Looking into docker hub, [https://hub.docker.com/r/devopsdockeruh/pull_exercise], we found that the password is "basics".

Once we entered the password, we are told the secrete message:

```
You found the correct password. Secret message is:
"This is the secret message"
```
